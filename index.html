                    <p>Greetings! Currently, I’m Senior at Southwest Career and Technical Academy, where I’ve been studying Web Design for the past three years. My passion resides in working with both digital and physical mediums of art. My role throughout this project was designing the website, as well as controlling all visuals related to the project. </p>

                    <p>Hey there! I’m currently a Senior in the Web Design and Development program area at Southwest CTA. I’ve been in the Las Vegas area for most of my life, but I’ve had the privilege of traveling to many different places. My main passion is medicine, primarily because I really like the idea of being able to help people. I want to be able to impact lives of people that I work with in a positive way, and I want this to be true for everything that I do. My role in this project was to assist in outlining the site’s structure, as well as lead the development tasks.</p>
